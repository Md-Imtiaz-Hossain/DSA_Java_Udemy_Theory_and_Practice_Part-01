        /**

         The author introduces linked lists and discusses their differences compared to array lists, emphasizing that linked
         lists are dynamic and flexible, while arrays have a fixed length. The key points highlighted include:

         1. **Indexing:**
         - Array lists allow direct access to elements through indexes, while linked lists do not provide this feature.
         Indexing is removed as a characteristic of linked lists.

         2. **Memory Representation:**
         - Unlike array lists and arrays, where elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, linked lists have nodes
         scattered in memory. The visual representation uses purple circles for linked lists to visually differentiate them
         from the green squares representing array lists.

         3. **Pointers and Nodes:**
         - Linked lists consist of nodes, each with a pointer pointing to the next node. The first node is accessed through a
         variable called `head`, and the last node is accessed through a variable called `tail`. The `tail` pointer of the last
         node typically points to NULL, indicating the end of the list.

         4. **Dynamic Nature:**
         - Linked lists are dynamic data structures, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion of elements, as nodes can be
         easily rearranged by updating pointers. This dynamic nature is contrasted with the fixed length of arrays.

         5. **Memory Layout:**
         - The article visually depicts the memory layout of linked lists, with nodes scattered and connected through pointers,
         in contrast to the contiguous layout of arrays.
