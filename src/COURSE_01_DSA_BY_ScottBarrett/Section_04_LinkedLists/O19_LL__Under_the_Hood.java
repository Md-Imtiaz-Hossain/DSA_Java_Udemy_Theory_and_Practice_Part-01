         The author explains the concept of linked lists under the hood, emphasizing the idea that each node in a
         linked list is a combination of a value and a pointer, functioning somewhat like a nested hash map.
         Here's a summary of the key points:

         1. **Node as a Hash Map:**
         - The author suggests thinking of each node in a linked list as a hash map, combining both the value and the
         pointer within the same entity.
         - This representation is not a literal hash map but serves as a conceptual analogy.

         2. **Adding a Node to the End:**
         - When adding a new node to the end of the linked list, the pointer of the current tail node is set equal to
         the new node.
         - This action is similar to setting a variable equal to a hash map in a nested structure.

         3. **Node Pointers:**
         - The pointer within a node points to the next node in the linked list.
         - Setting a pointer equal to a node essentially means that the variable is pointing to that node.

         4. **Head and Tail Pointers:**
         - The head pointer is set equal to the first node in the linked list, making it the starting point.
         - The tail pointer is updated to point to the last node, facilitating efficient addition of new nodes.

         5. **Conceptual vs. Under-the-Hood Representation:**
         - The conceptual diagram of a linked list is often presented visually for clarity.
         - Under the hood, each node is a combination of a value and a pointer, forming a linked structure.

         Understanding the linked list as a combination of values and pointers helps to conceptualize the dynamic
         connections between nodes. This conceptualization simplifies the process of adding nodes to the list and
         updating pointers. The under-the-hood representation is more abstract but provides insight into how the data
         structure is implemented.
